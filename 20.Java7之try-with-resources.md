#20.Java7之try-with-resources

## 释放资源

Prior to Java SE 7, you can use a finally block to ensure that a resource is closed regardless of whether the try statement completes normally or abruptly. The following example uses a finally block instead of a try-with-resources statement:

在Java7之前，你需要在`finally`语句块中释放资源而不管`try`语句块正常结束抑或中断抛出异常。例如：

```
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path));
try {
  return br.readLine();
} finally {
  if (br != null) br.close();
}
```
