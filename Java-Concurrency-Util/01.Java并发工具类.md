#01.Java并发工具类

Java 5 added a new Java package to the Java platform, the java.util.concurrent package. This package contains a set of classes that makes it easier to develop concurrent (multithreaded) applications in Java. Before this package was added, you would have to program your utility classes yourself.

In this tutorial I will take you through the new java.util.concurrent classes, one by one, so you can learn how to use them. I will use the versions in Java 6. I am not sure if there are any differences to the Java 5 versions.

I will not explain the core issues of concurrency in Java - the theory behind it, that is. If you are interested in that, check out my Java Concurrency tutorial.


Work in Progress

This tutorial is very much "work in progress", so if you spot a missing class or interface, please be patient. I will add it when I get the time to do it.
