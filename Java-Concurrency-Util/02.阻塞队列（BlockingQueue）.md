#02.阻塞队列（BlockingQueue）

在Java `java.util.concurrent`包中的*BlockingQueue*类是一个线程安全的阻塞队列类，在这个类中，入列和出类的操作都是线程安全的。

##BlockingQueue用法（BlockingQueue Usage）

阻塞队列（BlockingQueue）通常被用于**生产消费者模式**。看下面这张图：

The producing thread will keep producing new objects and insert them into the queue, until the queue reaches some upper bound on what it can contain. It's limit, in other words. If the blocking queue reaches its upper limit, the producing thread is blocked while trying to insert the new object. It remains blocked until a consuming thread takes an object out of the queue.

The consuming thread keeps taking objects out of the blocking queue, and processes them. If the consuming thread tries to take an object out of an empty queue, the consuming thread is blocked until a producing thread puts an object into the queue.


##BlockingQueue的方法（BlockingQueue Methods）

A BlockingQueue has 4 different sets of methods for inserting, removing and examining the elements in the queue. Each set of methods behaves differently in case the requested operation cannot be carried out immediately. Here is a table of the methods:

 	Throws Exception	Special Value	Blocks	Times Out
Insert	add(o)	offer(o)	put(o)	offer(o, timeout, timeunit)
Remove	remove(o)	poll(o)	take(o)	poll(timeout, timeunit)
Examine	element(o)	peek(o)	 	 
The 4 different sets of behaviour means this:

Throws Exception: 
If the attempted operation is not possible immediately, an exception is thrown.
Special Value: 
If the attempted operation is not possible immediately, a special value is returned (often true / false).
Blocks: 
If the attempted operation is not possible immedidately, the method call blocks until it is.
Times Out: 
If the attempted operation is not possible immedidately, the method call blocks until it is, but waits no longer than the given timeout. Returns a special value telling whether the operation succeeded or not (typically true / false).
It is not possible to insert null into a BlockingQueue. If you try to insert null, the BlockingQueue will throw a NullPointerException.

It is also possible to access all the elements inside a BlockingQueue, and not just the elements at the start and end. For instance, say you have queued an object for processing, but your application decides to cancel it. You can then call e.g. remove(o) to remove a specific object in the queue. However, this is not done very efficiently, so you should not use these Collection methods unless you really have to.

##BlockingQueue的实现类（BlockingQueue Implementations）

Since BlockingQueue is an interface, you need to use one of its implementations to use it. The java.util.concurrent package has the following implementations of the BlockingQueue interface (in Java 6):

ArrayBlockingQueue
DelayQueue
LinkedBlockingQueue
PriorityBlockingQueue
SynchronousQueue

##BlockingQueue示例（Java BlockingQueue Example）

Here is a Java BlockingQueue example. The example uses the ArrayBlockingQueue implementation of the BlockingQueue interface.

First, the BlockingQueueExample class which starts a Producer and a Consumer in separate threads. The Producer inserts strings into a shared BlockingQueue, and the Consumer takes them out.

public class BlockingQueueExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        BlockingQueue queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue(1024);

        Producer producer = new Producer(queue);
        Consumer consumer = new Consumer(queue);

        new Thread(producer).start();
        new Thread(consumer).start();

        Thread.sleep(4000);
    }
}
Here is the Producer class. Notice how it sleeps a second between each put() call. This will cause the Consumer to block, while waiting for objects in the queue.

public class Producer implements Runnable{

    protected BlockingQueue queue = null;

    public Producer(BlockingQueue queue) {
        this.queue = queue;
    }

    public void run() {
        try {
            queue.put("1");
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            queue.put("2");
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            queue.put("3");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Here is the Consumer class. It just takes out the objects from the queue, and prints them to System.out.

public class Consumer implements Runnable{

    protected BlockingQueue queue = null;

    public Consumer(BlockingQueue queue) {
        this.queue = queue;
    }

    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println(queue.take());
            System.out.println(queue.take());
            System.out.println(queue.take());
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
