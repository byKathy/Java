#02.阻塞队列（BlockingQueue）

在Java `java.util.concurrent`包中的*BlockingQueue*是一个线程安全的阻塞队列接口，在这个接口中，入列和出类的操作都是线程安全的。

##BlockingQueue用法（BlockingQueue Usage）

阻塞队列（BlockingQueue）通常被用于**生产消费者模式**。看下面这张图：

![A BlockingQueue with one thread putting into it, and another thread taking from it.](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-concurrency-utils/blocking-queue.png)

**生产者线程**生产新的对象，并把对象插入到队列中，直到队列中元素达到上限。如果阻塞队列达到了上限，则尝试插入对象的生产者线程会进入阻塞状态，它们会一直阻塞直到有**消费者线程**从队列中取出对象。

**消费者线程**会持续从阻塞队列中取出对象并进行相应处理。如果消费者线程试图从空的阻塞队列中取出对象，则会进入阻塞状态，直到有生产者线程向队列中插入对象。

##BlockingQueue的方法（BlockingQueue Methods）

*BlockingQueue*分别有四种用于**入列**和**出列**的方法。每种方法都有不同的处理行为用以处理不同的应用场景：

每一套方法表现不同的情况下所请求的操作不能被立即进行。下面是该方法的一个表：

A BlockingQueue has 4 different sets of methods for inserting, removing and examining the elements in the queue. Each set of methods behaves differently in case the requested operation cannot be carried out immediately. Here is a table of the methods:

||Throws Exception|	Special Value|	Blocks|	Times Out
 ------|--------------|------------|--------------|----------------
Insert |	add(o)	| offer(o) |	put(o)	|offer(o, timeout, timeunit)
Remove |	remove(o) |	poll(o)|	take(o)	|poll(timeout, timeunit)
Examine |	element(o) |	peek(o)	 	 | |


The 4 different sets of behaviour means this:

Throws Exception: 
If the attempted operation is not possible immediately, an exception is thrown.
Special Value: 
If the attempted operation is not possible immediately, a special value is returned (often true / false).
Blocks: 
If the attempted operation is not possible immedidately, the method call blocks until it is.
Times Out: 
If the attempted operation is not possible immedidately, the method call blocks until it is, but waits no longer than the given timeout. Returns a special value telling whether the operation succeeded or not (typically true / false).
It is not possible to insert null into a BlockingQueue. If you try to insert null, the BlockingQueue will throw a NullPointerException.

It is also possible to access all the elements inside a BlockingQueue, and not just the elements at the start and end. For instance, say you have queued an object for processing, but your application decides to cancel it. You can then call e.g. remove(o) to remove a specific object in the queue. However, this is not done very efficiently, so you should not use these Collection methods unless you really have to.

##BlockingQueue的实现类（BlockingQueue Implementations）

Since BlockingQueue is an interface, you need to use one of its implementations to use it. The java.util.concurrent package has the following implementations of the BlockingQueue interface (in Java 6):

ArrayBlockingQueue
DelayQueue
LinkedBlockingQueue
PriorityBlockingQueue
SynchronousQueue

##BlockingQueue示例（Java BlockingQueue Example）

Here is a Java BlockingQueue example. The example uses the ArrayBlockingQueue implementation of the BlockingQueue interface.

First, the BlockingQueueExample class which starts a Producer and a Consumer in separate threads. The Producer inserts strings into a shared BlockingQueue, and the Consumer takes them out.

public class BlockingQueueExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        BlockingQueue queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue(1024);

        Producer producer = new Producer(queue);
        Consumer consumer = new Consumer(queue);

        new Thread(producer).start();
        new Thread(consumer).start();

        Thread.sleep(4000);
    }
}
Here is the Producer class. Notice how it sleeps a second between each put() call. This will cause the Consumer to block, while waiting for objects in the queue.

public class Producer implements Runnable{

    protected BlockingQueue queue = null;

    public Producer(BlockingQueue queue) {
        this.queue = queue;
    }

    public void run() {
        try {
            queue.put("1");
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            queue.put("2");
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            queue.put("3");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Here is the Consumer class. It just takes out the objects from the queue, and prints them to System.out.

public class Consumer implements Runnable{

    protected BlockingQueue queue = null;

    public Consumer(BlockingQueue queue) {
        this.queue = queue;
    }

    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println(queue.take());
            System.out.println(queue.take());
            System.out.println(queue.take());
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
